//! The trigger webhooks: when loop work waits on a domain whose MANIFEST
//! says `reflect_trigger: webhook` or `evolve_trigger: webhook`, the daemon
//! posts a signed webhook to the instance's `automation.webhook.url`, so an
//! automation service can start a runner without polling.
//!
//! The task never acts on an event alone (ruling R1): an event only arms a
//! look, and the look reads [`Engine::automation_status`], which is computed
//! from state. So a run's own writes cannot make its loop due, nothing is
//! sent while a lease is held (status reports `running` then) and nothing is
//! sent for a domain whose loop runs on another instance (`runs_on`).
//!
//! When it sends:
//! - Reflect, people waiting (a thread for the agent, feedback): one look
//!   [`PEOPLE_WINDOW`] after the first event, which coalesces the burst.
//! - Reflect, page updates only: after [`SOURCE_QUIET`] without a source
//!   change on the domain (an engram event there, or a move of its update
//!   count).
//! - Evolve: on the [`EVOLVE_TICK`], when the mechanical count reaches
//!   `automation.evolve_threshold` (once per crossing, not on every tick it
//!   stays above it).
//! - When a lease goes away and work is still due, at once (seen on the
//!   [`LEASE_TICK`]); for evolve the threshold still applies.
//! - While the loop backs off after failed runs, nothing; the slot looks
//!   again every [`RATE_LIMIT`] and sends what it was owed once the wait
//!   ends.
//!
//! Reflect sends again whenever a look finds people still waiting (any
//! event arms one), held only by the cap below; evolve sends again only on
//! a new crossing, a release or a failed delivery.
//!
//! At most one delivery per domain and loop per [`RATE_LIMIT`], and that cap
//! wins over everything above, a release included. A failed attempt is
//! retried after each of [`RETRY_DELAYS`], unless a run took the lease in
//! the meantime; every attempt is logged, and the outcome is recorded with
//! [`Engine::record_delivery`]. A delivery whose attempts all failed stays
//! owed and is sent again, while the work is due, after the next of
//! [`FAILED_DELIVERY_WAITS`]. The body carries counts only, never content
//! or paths, and the secret is never logged.
