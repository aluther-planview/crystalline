//! The host-lock fence of a Reflection write that is not a walk.
//!
//! On a shared database only the instance that holds a domain's host lock
//! writes its Reflection. Every such write passes the gate first
//! ([`Engine::confirm_reflection_host`]), then writes its files on this
//! disk, then its rows. A host that pauses (a sleeping laptop, a stopped
//! process) between the gate and the rows can lose the lock in between, and
//! its rows would then land in the shared database behind the new host's
//! back. So the rows commit in one transaction that first reads the lock
//! row the way a walk's apply does (`FOR SHARE` on Postgres) and goes on
//! only while this instance still holds it.
//!
//! A refused write keeps what the person or agent sent in the kept folder
//! (as a room keeps a text it could not save), puts every file it already
//! changed on this disk back to what it was, and answers the
//! `hosted_elsewhere` refusal naming the new host. A file is put back only
//! while it still holds exactly what this write left there: on a volume
//! several hosts share, another host may have written it since, and that
//! newer file stays. A file that cannot be put back stays as the write left
//! it and is logged. The file that holds the sent text is put back only
//! once that text is kept, so nothing is ever deleted that is the only copy
//! of anything.
