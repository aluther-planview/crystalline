//! Threads: discussions anchored on a passage of a document, stored in a
//! thread file the document's kind places. One `##` per thread. The model is
//! the familiar document comment: an anchor on a section plus a quoted
//! passage, a status, and a history that is only ever appended to. The
//! format knows no kind of document: the anchor names its section by id or
//! by heading, and the caller hands in how to find that section's text.
//! Where a kind keeps its thread file is that kind's own choice.
