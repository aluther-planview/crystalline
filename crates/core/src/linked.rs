//! The linked-file planner: which local files imported notes link to, where
//! each one goes under the domain's `assets/` and how the links are rewritten.
//!
//! An import brings Markdown notes from a folder or an archive. Their pictures
//! and documents sit beside them under whatever names the source gave them
//! (`report.pdf.assets/page-3.png`, `Q3 report (final).pdf`), and a Crystalline
//! domain keeps such files only under `assets/`, in names a link can carry.
//! This module settles, before a byte is written, which of those files are
//! taken, the clean asset path each one gets, and the note text with every
//! link pointing at it. It is pure: the files are reached through a
//! [`LinkedSource`], and what the domain already holds through a callback.
//!
//! The rules:
//!
//! - A target is read the way the rest of the crate reads one: an inline link
//!   or image outside inline code and fenced blocks (a table cell is ordinary
//!   text), or a reference definition, either markdown form, the `#fragment`
//!   split off, backslash escapes removed and percent-decoded. So `a%20b.png`
//!   and `<a b.png>` name one file.
//! - A URL (anything with a scheme), a bare `#anchor`, a note (`.md`) and a
//!   link already under `assets/` are not files and are left alone without a
//!   report. A target with a leading `/` is reported as outside.
//! - A target is resolved against the note's folder; one that climbs out of
//!   the source is outside. The checks then run in this order: the file must
//!   exist ([`NotTakenReason::Missing`], also for a folder or a file that
//!   cannot be read), carry an allowlisted extension
//!   ([`NotTakenReason::NotAllowed`]), be at most [`MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`]
//!   ([`NotTakenReason::TooLarge`]), and both its name and the note's path
//!   must clean into a valid asset path ([`NotTakenReason::BadName`]).
//! - The dest is `assets/` + every segment of the note's path without `.md`,
//!   cleaned, + `/` + the cleaned file name. When that is longer than an asset
//!   path may be, the folder is the first 8 hex digits of the file's sha256.
//! - Files are deduplicated by sha256 across the whole run: the first note to
//!   link a file decides where its bytes are stored, and every link to the
//!   same bytes, under any name, points there.
//! - A dest the domain already holds with the same bytes is reused; one it
//!   holds with other bytes, or one an earlier file of this run claimed, gets
//!   the `-2`, `-3` suffix ([`suffixed_asset_path`]), up to 99. A file that
//!   finds no free name is reported as a bad name.
//! - A rewritten link keeps its alt text, its title and its `#fragment`; the
//!   dest is written bare, since a clean name never needs angle brackets. A
//!   link that is not taken is left exactly as written.
