/**
 * The size check for the `/π` route's lazy chunks (M4 C30), the main chunk's
 * gzip guideline and the cap on eager JS ({@link EAGER_JS_CAP_BYTES}).
 *
 * Pure Node module, no DOM: it only reads a Vite manifest object and asks
 * for a gzip size, so it typechecks under `tsconfig.node.json` and is
 * exercised by `src/bundleBudget.test.ts` without a build. `bundle-budget.ts`
 * is the CLI that reads the real manifest, gzips the real files and drives
 * this module from a CI step; keeping the walk and the reporting here, free
 * of `fs`/`zlib`, is what lets the test fixture stand in for a build.
 *
 * The walk (F5): first the main set, `index.html` and every key reachable
 * from it through `imports` alone (a production build's static graph, what
 * every visitor downloads before any route runs). Then a walk from
 * `GAME_ENTRY` over both `imports` and `dynamicImports`, but a key already in
 * the main set is never entered: a lazy chunk imports its own entry chunk
 * (Vite's manifest lists `index.html` in `ExploreRoute`'s `imports`), and
 * entering it from here would pull in every other lazy Fluid route through
 * the entry's own `dynamicImports`. A build without the route has no
 * `GAME_ENTRY` key at all; `gameFiles` then returns `[]` rather than
 * throwing, and the report fails with an error while `ROUTE_REQUIRED` holds,
 * which it does: the route ships in every build (F6).
