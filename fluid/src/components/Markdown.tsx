/**
 * Markdown, rendered in the browser. What every screen with something to read

 * It is a seam rather than the renderer: the renderer and its syntax
 * highlighter are the heaviest dependencies in this app after mermaid, and the
 * screen the app opens on draws no markdown at all. Behind a lazy import they
 * are a chunk that arrives with the first document rather than bytes every
 * visit pays for. Measured on this app at the time it was split: 368 kB raw,
 * 112 kB gzipped, which was half the entry bundle.
 *
 * The rules that shape what the renderer will and will not draw live with it,
 * in `MarkdownBody.tsx`.
