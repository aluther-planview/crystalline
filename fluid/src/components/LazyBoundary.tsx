/**
 * The boundary every lazy part of Fluid waits behind: `Suspense` with the
 * part's own loading shape while its chunk is on the way, and a short
 * message with a reload button if the chunk never arrives.
 *
 * Only a {@link ChunkLoadError} is caught (see `lazyChunk.ts`). Any other
 * error is thrown on from here, so a bug in a screen still fails a test and
 * still reaches the console the way it did before this boundary existed.
 * React keeps a failed lazy import's rejection for the life of the page, so
 * trying again in place cannot work; a reload fetches the new `index.html`
 * and the chunk names that go with it.

/**
 * The catching half. Every route draws its `LazyBoundary` at the same place
 * under the frame's outlet, and the domain page draws its cards at the same
 * place for every domain, so React keeps one instance of this across a
 * move. A failure is therefore remembered only for the path it happened on:
 * when `resetKey` (the pathname) changes, the error is dropped before the
 * next render, and the new route draws its own content. A key on the
 * boundary would do the same, but it would also remount every screen under
 * it on each path change, which the engram screen, for one, does not do
 * today.
 *
 * React reports an error each boundary catches, so an error this one throws
 * on is logged twice: once here and once where it lands. A boundary cannot
 * decline an error before React reports it, so that second line is the price
 * of catching only chunk failures.
