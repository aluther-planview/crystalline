/**
 * The two ways of looking at a domain, Reflection and Engrams, and the one
 * notice that stands in for them when the Reflection lives on another
 * instance.
 *
 * Eager and small: it sits in the top bar, so it must cost the entry almost
 * nothing. It draws itself from `GET /domains/{d}/reflection`,
 * which never answers 409; a failed read draws nothing, because a switch
 * offering a mode that might not be there is worse than none. A reader who
 * cannot read engrams (a contributor) has one mode, and a switch with one
 * position is not a switch, so nothing is drawn for them either.
 *
 * The notice that stands where a Reflection screen would, while it cannot be
 * shown, lives in `ReflectionStateNotice.tsx` instead: only the lazy
 * Reflection screens draw it, so it stays out of the entry.
