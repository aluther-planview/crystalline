/**
 * The same engram, read the way an agent reads it.
 *
 * Three facts, and none of them are on the page anywhere else in this shape.
 * The domain's routing lines are what sends an agent here in the first place,
 * and they live in the MANIFEST rather than in the engram, so a reader editing
 * knowledge nobody retrieves has no other way to see why. The salience is what
 * ranks this engram once it is in the running. The token cost is what reading
 * it spends out of a budget the reader never sees.
 *
 * The cost is an estimate and says so. Characters over four is the rule of
 * thumb, not a count from a tokenizer, and a number presented as measured would
 * be a number somebody plans against.
 *
 * Everything here is what the engram and its domain actually carry. A salience
 * nobody wrote has no row, in the same way an absent `valid_to` has none on the
 * frontmatter panel: the honest rendering of a fact nobody recorded is nothing
 * at all.
 *
 * Folded away by default, and opened from the Explore row in the details rail,
 * which owns the switch: this draws the panel only. This is a second way of
 * reading a page whose first job is the prose.
