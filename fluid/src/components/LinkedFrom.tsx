/**
 * Which engrams link here, by title.
 *
 * One row per referencing engram: its title as a link to it, and the relation
 * it points with as small mono text on the right (`links_to` for a prose
 * wikilink). The rows come from the inbound endpoint, a page at a time, so an
 * engram a thousand engrams point at never loads them all: the first few rows
 * are drawn, "Show all N" opens the list the first page carries, and "Show
 * more" asks for the next page.
 *
 * Rows stay in the order the server answers them (by title), and a page that
 * arrives is appended below the rows already shown: a row never appears above
 * one the reader has already read. The relations are not grouped for the same
 * reason; their counts stand in a muted line above the rows instead.
 *
 * Past {@link FILTER_FROM} references a filter field appears. It asks the
 * server, which matches on title and path, and while it holds text every match
 * is listed rather than the first few.
 *
 * The first paint costs no request at all when nothing points here: the detail
 * payload already carries the exact whole-index `inboundCount`, so a zero is
 * answered from what the page has already read.
 *
 * An engram nothing points at says so. "Nothing links here yet" is a fact about
 * the knowledge base and an invitation to connect it; an empty block would read
 * as a panel that failed to load.
