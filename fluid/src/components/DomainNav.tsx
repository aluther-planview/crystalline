/**
 * The sidebar once a domain is open: which domain you are in, and what is in
 * it.
 *
 * A domain is a place somebody works in rather than an entry they picked once,
 * so while they are inside one the sidebar stops being a list of everything and
 * becomes the way around this one thing: an Overview row that goes to the
 * domain's front page, and the folder tree below it, which is the domain's
 * own shape rather than a flat listing of it. The domain's name is not
 * repeated here (spec 4.4): the top bar's switcher names it, and it is also
 * the way across to another domain and back out to every domain.
 *
 * The tree is walked rather than downloaded. `GET /domains/{d}/tree` answers
 * one folder at a time - its subfolder names and the engrams directly in it -
 * and this asks for a folder only when somebody opens it. A deep fetch would
 * mean pulling every engram of a domain into the frame around every screen,
 * and the folder structure below the first level would still have to be
 * inferred from engram paths. Each folder is cached under the same key the
 * domain screen uses (`treeKey`), so the root costs nothing when a reader is
 * already looking at it and an expanded folder stays expanded for free.
 *
 * The folders on the way to the engram being read start open, because a mark
 * on a row nobody can see marks nothing. The folder being browsed on the
 * screen beside the tree counts as being there too: it opens, and its row
 * carries the same you-are-here mark an engram row does - until a frontmatter
 * filter goes on, when the screen leaves the folder for the whole domain and
 * no row may claim to be the page on screen. Opening and marking are two
 * questions here, and the second one is the screen's own to answer.
 *
 * A folder row is two controls rather than one. Its name is a link to that
 * folder on the domain screen, which is where a folder of any size can be
 * paged; its folder icon is a button that looks inside the sidebar without
 * moving the screen. They are siblings, never nested: a link inside a button
 * is an accessibility violation, and a reader would have no way to say which
 * of the two they meant. A level the server had to cut ends in one more row - the
 * whole folder, on the screen - because the sidebar is a way around a domain
 * rather than a place to render ten thousand rows.
