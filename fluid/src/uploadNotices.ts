 * Notices about uploads whose screen has gone.

 * An upload outlives the editor that started it: a person can press Done or
 * follow a link while the bytes are still on their way. When such an upload
 * then fails, or lands without its link, the editor that would have said so
 * is gone. The notice comes here instead, and one host at the top of the app
 * (`UploadNotices`) shows it whatever screen is open now. A plain module
 * store rather than a context: the reporter is a callback that runs after
 * its component unmounted, so it can no longer reach anything React holds.
