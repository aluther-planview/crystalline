 * y-codemirror.next skips its write-back into `Y.Text` only while the
 * transaction still carries the annotation its sync plugin dispatched with,
 * and a transaction rebuilt by the filter below has lost it: the plugin would
 * re-apply a remote insert INTO the shared text and every participant would
 * end up with it twice, with the buffer and the document permanently apart.
 * Session text may legitimately hold a lone CR - the server admits a stray-CR
 * file and broadcasts such lines from a merge - so this is a live path, not a
 * theoretical one.
 *
 * The annotation type is not reachable: y-codemirror.next 0.3.5, the current
 * release, exports `ySyncFacet` and `YSyncConfig` but not `ySyncAnnotation`,
 * and its `exports` map admits no deep import. So the binding is recognized by
 * what it guarantees instead. It dispatches from the `Y.Text` observer, with
 * the shared text ALREADY carrying the change, so the document this
 * transaction produces IS the shared text. A local edit runs the other way -
 * Yjs is written after the transaction lands - so the two still differ here.
 * A state with no binding has no facet and no write-back to protect.
