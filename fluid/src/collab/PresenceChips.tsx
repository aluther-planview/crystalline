/**
 * Who is in the room, as a row of overlapping avatars in the editor's header.
 *
 * Each avatar wears the color the participant's caret, selection and name
 * flag are painted in inside the text, so a cursor on the page and a circle in
 * the header are recognisably the same person. The list itself carries the
 * names ("In this session: ..."), so a screen reader hears who is here without
 * walking the row; each avatar also holds its name as text for the same
 * reason, with the initial drawn for sighted readers only.
 *
 * An agent working in the document is one of the avatars rather than a notice
 * of its own: it is in here, it is changing the text under your cursor, and it
 * has a name and a color like anybody else. Its avatar shows a robot glyph
 * instead of an initial, so somebody watching a line appear knows whether a
 * colleague or an agent wrote it.
