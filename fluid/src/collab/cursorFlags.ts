/**
 * Name flags on the other people's carets: each remote caret carries its
 * owner's name in their own color, always, rather than only while the pointer
 * hovers it (the binding's default). The flag is the binding's own element,
 * restyled; its background is the caret's color, and its text takes the ink
 * that reads on that color (`inkOn`), set once the binding has drawn it.
 *
 * The flag is small enough to sit in the space between two lines of text at
 * the reading line height (12px type on a 12px line), so it rests on the
 * caret's top without covering the line above.
 *
 * `Prec.high`, because the binding's base theme sets the same properties and
 * the view mounts style modules in reverse order: at default precedence this
 * would lose to the rule it overrides.
