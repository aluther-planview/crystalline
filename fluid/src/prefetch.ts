/**
 * Warming a lazy screen's chunk while the pointer is still on its way to it.
 *
 * Every screen behind a `lazy` route in `routes.tsx` costs one extra request
 * the first time somebody opens it, and that request starts when the click
 * lands - which is the worst possible moment, because it is the moment a
 * reader starts waiting. A pointer entering a link, or the keyboard landing
 * on it, says the same thing a click says a few hundred milliseconds early,
 * and that is the whole trick: the fetch starts on the intent rather than on
 * the act, and by the time the route changes the chunk is usually already in
 * the module cache.
 *
 * Nothing here is a promise anybody waits on. A warm that has not finished
 * when the click lands is not a failure - the route's own `Suspense` fallback
 * covers it exactly as it would have without any of this - and a warm that
 * never happens because nobody hovered anything costs nothing at all. That is
 * why this is spread onto links rather than run on a timer at startup: a
 * reader who never opens an engram never fetches the engram screen.
 *
 * The imports are the same specifiers `routes.tsx` uses, which is what makes
 * them the same chunk rather than a second copy: the bundler keys a dynamic
 * import by the module it resolves to, and the module cache makes every call
 * after the first one free.

 * What has been asked for already, by name. A name leaves the set when its
