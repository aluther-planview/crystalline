/**
 * The MANIFEST editor's own session behavior, as opposed to the route wiring

 *
 * The screen holds none of this itself any more: buffer, checksum, the Mod-S
 * save and the draft safety net all come from `useEditorSession`, which the
 * engram editor uses too. That is exactly why the screen needs its own net -
 * a change to the shared shell must not be able to quietly unwire the editor
 * that has no other test watching it, and the save keybinding in particular
 * now raises the shared `crystalline:save` event rather than a name of its
 * own.
