/**
 * Done in a room: the server saves the room on its own, so leaving is usually
 * just leaving. A standing conflict holds every save, so Done keeps the text
 * as a draft at once and says so. Not while that save is owed - a save in flight, a refused one,
 * a conflict, or the socket away. Then Done asks the room to save now and
 * waits a moment for it to land; once it has, the editor leaves. If it does
 * not land in time, the text is kept as a draft on this device, the editor
 * says so, and leaves a beat later. Nothing is lost without a word.
