/**
 * The raster bars on the connecting screen's border: once the modems'
 * high tones start (`burstsAtMs` in `audio/modem.ts`), the light blue
 * around the panel fills with horizontal bars in the C64's sixteen
 * colours, scrolling down with a slow sway, the way a demo's border or a
 * tape loader's stripes run. The panel with the typed text is drawn over
 * them and stays as it is.
 *
 * One element carries the bars as a fixed gradient; a frame loop moves its
 * background position, so nothing re-renders at the frame rate. The loop
 * runs on `performance.now()` from the commit that shows the screen, the
 * clock `useC64Screen` starts in the same commit (its own `elapsed` stops
 * once the typing is done, so it cannot drive the bars). The loop and the
 * timer that turns the bars on stop when the screen goes.
 *
 * Their colours and their motion are in `raster.ts`, with why they never
 * flash. With `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` the bars show still from
 * the same moment and no frame is requested; a change of the preference
 * while the screen shows starts or stops the loop. The bars are decoration,
 * hidden from a screen reader.
