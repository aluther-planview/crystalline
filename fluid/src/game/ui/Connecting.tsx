/**
 * The connecting screen: the station dialling in when it starts (M4 C26).
 *
 * A full-screen C64 frame in the device refusal's colours types out, at
 * `TYPE_CPS` characters a second, the dial command with the number, the
 * modem's answer and the name of the place dialled into, while the
 * director plays the dial-in (`audio/modem.ts`). It is done (`onDone`)
 * after `HANDSHAKE_MS`, or at once on any key or click; the host then cuts
 * the sound and hands the station its keys back. The frame, the
 * typing clock, the focus and the skip (a browser's shortcut is left
 * alone) are shared with the opening (`c64Clock.ts`, `c64Screen.tsx`).
 * Once the modems' high tones start (`burstsAtMs`), the border shows
 * raster bars (`RasterBars.tsx`); the panel and its text stay as they are.
 *
 * The host clears `busy` inside `onDone`, and the `preventDefault` on the
 * key taken is what keeps an Esc that skips this screen from also pausing
 * the station behind it.
 *
 * The typing runs on `performance.now()`, the station's own clock, so a
 * wall clock set back or stepped forward neither stalls the lines nor
 * prints them all at once. The screen takes the focus when it shows and
 * gives it back to what had it when it goes. A screen reader hears each
 * line once it is typed out: the typed characters are hidden from it, and
 * a polite live region, mounted empty with the screen, is handed every
 * whole line.
