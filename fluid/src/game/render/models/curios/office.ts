/**
 * The office curios' recipes (0.25.1): the floppy disk, the pizza box, the
 * lottery ticket, the 5.25 inch disk and the report sheets, the desk,
 * snack and paper slots' kinds. Colours and helpers
 * stay in this file, which imports only `common.ts` of the curio batches.
 * Nothing lights and nothing blinks.
 *
 * Every print lies on a face that looks up, where no quad can lie, so each
 * is laid by `flatText` as thin boxes of merged runs, as the tape drive's
 * badge is (`retro.ts`): its first row towards `-d`, so it reads from the
 * curio's front (`+d`), left to right along `+a`.
 *
 * - The floppy disk lies flat: a 90 by 94 mm square of dark plastic
 *   (`FLOPPY_BODY`) 3.3 mm thick with its back right corner cut off on
 *   the slant, a light grey metal shutter (`FLOPPY_SHUTTER`) over its back
 *   quarter, and a white label (`FLOPPY_LABEL`) over the front of it,
 *   carrying `MARKS.floppyLabel` in a blue ballpoint ink (`FLOPPY_INK`).
 *   v1 is the same disk with the second label, printed rather than
 *   handwritten: a yellow band (`FLOPPY_BAND`) across the label's back
 *   part carrying `MARKS.floppyPrinted`, and on the white part in front of
 *   it the version line `MARKS.floppyVersion`, both in a black print
 *   (`FLOPPY_PRINT`, `FLOPPY_PRINTED`).
 * - The pizza box is a flat square box of white-grey cardboard
 *   (`PIZZA_BASE`) 0.045 m tall under a slightly lighter lid
 *   (`PIZZA_LID`), `MARKS.pizzaLid` printed in red (`PIZZA_PRINT`) across
 *   the lid's top. v0 is one closed box; v1 and v2 stack two and three,
 *   each turned a little by `STACK_TURNS`, with the print on the top box
 *   alone. v3 is one box open: the base an open tray, the lid standing up
 *   from the tray's back edge, its front flap folded back at the top, and
 *   in the tray one slice (`PIZZA_SLICE`, a flat wedge with a crust and
 *   three red discs) and a few crumbs. The open lid's print faces the
 *   back and is not drawn.
 * - The lottery ticket is a 100 by 60 mm strip of pale paper
 *   (`TICKET_PAPER`) lying flat, a coloured band (`TICKET_BAND`) across
 *   its back edge, and the six `MARKS.numbers` in a dark ink
 *   (`TICKET_INK`) in two rows of three, each number set on its own in its
 *   slot (`TICKET_SLOTS`), and nothing else printed on it.
 * - The 5.25 inch disk lies flat: a 133 mm square of black flexible
 *   sleeve (`DISK_SLEEVE`) 2 mm thick, the write-protect notch cut out of
 *   its right edge. In its middle the sleeve's round opening shows the
 *   brown medium (`DISK_MEDIUM`), the medium's pale reinforcement ring
 *   (`DISK_RING`) and the dark hub hole (`DISK_HOLE`) at its centre; the
 *   oval head window in front of the hub and the small index hole beside
 *   it show the medium too. A printed paper label (`DISK_LABEL`) runs
 *   across the back edge, `MARKS.diskLabel` printed on it in red
 *   (`DISK_PRINT`) with a grey disc (`DISK_GLOBE`) beside it, as the
 *   printed original has (`DISK`).
 * - The report sheets are US letter sheets (0.216 by 0.279 m) lying flat.
 *   The cover sheet (`COVER_PAPER`) carries the original's layout within
 *   what may be drawn (`COVER`, from the 0.25.1 small props research): the
 *   heading `MARKS.reportTitle` across the upper quarter in a black print
 *   (`COVER_PRINT`), under it at the right the date word `MARKS.reportDate`
 *   with a rule after it, six blank field rules down the middle, and at
 *   the lower right an empty stamp box outlined by four thin strips, all
 *   rules in a grey print (`COVER_RULE`). v0 is the cover sheet alone, v1
 *   a short stack of plain sheets (`STACK_PAPER`) under it, v2 a tall
 *   stack in three blocks, each turned a little by `SHEET_TURNS`. Only the
 *   top sheet is a cover sheet, so nothing under it is printed.
