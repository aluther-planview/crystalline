/**
 * The street pieces: the red bike and the blue police box, two machines
 * from the street that ended up aboard, and the neon bike beside the
 * bike. All three are lit on the `breathe` bank (C13). The police box's
 * two door leaves are the one thing on any of them that moves.
 *
 * - The bike (`BIKE`) is a long racing motorcycle parked on its side
 *   stand, its length along `a` and its nose at `+a`, glossy red. Its two
 *   fat round tyres are its two ends (`BIKE_WHEELS`), each under a red
 *   domed cover that hides the hub. Over the front wheel stands the high
 *   fairing with its side skirts, the wide headlight in a black panel on
 *   its flat nose and the tall dark windscreen sweeping up and back from
 *   it to the bike's top over the dash and the handlebar. The middle is
 *   open and low: a floor pan over the black chassis and a bucket seat
 *   with a tall backrest. Behind it the rear cowl rises as high as the
 *   fairing, rounds over and slopes down over the rear wheel, ending
 *   ahead of the tyre, the tail light breathing on its slope; a white
 *   pinstripe runs under its top. The panels are built in slices, the
 *   narrower ones grown proud of the wider (`grown`), so their edges read
 *   rounded. Round engine covers sit low behind the seat, and on the left
 *   the swing arm runs to the rear axle. It stands upright (C14): the kit
 *   has no roll, so the stand is a bar from the floor pan down to the
 *   floor on its `-d` side. Its stickers (`BIKE_STICKERS`, 2.6f C13) are
 *   not mirrored, as on the original: the left side carries the watch and
 *   camera makers' on its skirt and a helmet maker's on the front wheel
 *   cover, with a star roundel; the right side the big two-line sticker
 *   and a smiley on its skirt and the other helmet maker's on the cover.
 * - The police box stands free, centred on its anchor like any free hero
 *   (2.6e: never against a wall), its doors facing `+d` (C3, C10): deep blue
 *   painted wood on a low plinth, a corner post from the plinth to the roof at
 *   each corner, a black sign band under the
 *   roof on all four sides with its words in white block pixels
 *   (`BOX_SIGN`, laid out by `boxSignLayout`), a roof in two steps under
 *   a small lamp in a white cage that breathes, and on every side two
 *   columns of raised panels under a window of small frosted panes that
 *   glow faintly. On the front the two columns are the two door leaves,
 *   each built by `boxDoor` as a slab of its own; the left one carries the
 *   white door notice with its lines in black (`MARKS.boxNotice`, 2.6f
 *   C13), which swings with it.
 *   It is built in its own terms (`BOX_BODY`), `d` running from its back
 *   (0) to the posts' front (`BOX.front`), half its depth behind the
 *   anchor, so the whole box, the back sign included, stays inside its
 *   footprint.
 * - The police box's body is hollow (2.6e C10): a back wall, two side
 *   walls lined in a pale white on the inside, a roof slab over the
 *   doorway and a floor on the plinth, and on the back wall's inner face a
 *   panel that shines white by itself (`INSIDE`), so through the open
 *   doors the box glows. Every outside face stands where the solid body's
 *   did.
 * - The leaves are movers (`boxLeafMovers`, C16): the instanced mesh
 *   leaves them out and each is a `wing` of its own in world space, hinged
 *   at its outer post (`boxHinge`) and turned inward by `BOX_SWING` at
 *   full open, the two opposite ways, both under the one key
 *   `boxKey(index)`, so they open and close together. That is the one
 *   door motion; the recipe builds them in place, closed, only when asked
 *   to (`movers`), which the model checks are.
 * - The neon bike (`CYCLE`) is the enclosed racing cycle from inside the
 *   computer, parked like the red bike: its length along `a`, its nose at
 *   `+a`, built to the film model's proportions. Two fat wheels of one
 *   size, a quarter of its length across, are its ends (`CYCLE_WHEELS`),
 *   each a glowing tread under a dark cover on each side, so only the rim
 *   glows. The shell (`CYCLE_SHELL`) is dark and glossy, its top 1.8
 *   wheels high, and its flank splits as on the original: an arched band
 *   (`CYCLE_BAND`) hoods both wheels over their tops and runs over the
 *   top, and a lower panel (`CYCLE_PANEL`) set in from it, a shade
 *   lighter (`CYCLE_LOWER`), runs low between the wheels, its front
 *   following the front arch and its corners on the belly rounded, to a
 *   square back edge that hides the rear wheel's front, so the split
 *   reads through its glowing line and the recess.
 *   Narrower crests are grown over both like the bike's panels (`grown`).
 *   The back (`CYCLE_SPINE`) rises from a short tail over the rear wheel,
 *   runs low under the canopy, climbs to a crown a little ahead of the
 *   middle and falls in a long curve to the nose. A short smoked canopy
 *   sits on the back over the hidden rider, behind the crown and clear of
 *   the nose: a rounded dome 12 to 15 cm over the crests (0.25.2,
 *   `CANOPY_ROUND`), its front and back ends rounded; the flanks carry no
 *   window. Glowing lines trace the band's outline a little inside it on
 *   both sides, so one runs along the split (`cycleLine`, laid by
 *   `profileLine`, which the red bike's pinstripe shares), and the
 *   canopy's ridge. Every light is in one group and breathes; the body
 *   carries no text. That is variant 0, the closed one.
 * - The neon bike's variant 1 is the open one (`CYCLE_OPEN`, 0.25.2): the
 *   same length and footprint, lower, with no canopy and no rider. Its
 *   wheels (`OPEN_WHEELS`) are hubless: fat black tyre rings round an
 *   open middle, so the floor shows through them, with a glowing ring on
 *   each side face near the outer edge (`OPEN_SIDE_GLOW`, 0.25.2) as on
 *   the full size cycle's photos. A low glossy body (`OPEN_BODY`)
 *   bridges them as a long flat wedge, reaching into each ring's open
 *   middle down to the axle line over its upper inner quarter only, and
 *   rising to its highest
 *   point at the tail behind the empty rider's place: a saddle hollow
 *   (`OPEN_SADDLE`) with a seat pad and a glowing seat line, two short
 *   handles at the front and two footrests at the back. Thin glowing
 *   lines run along each flank and over the top, in the closed one's
 *   light group.
 *
 * The numbers each kind is built to are named above its recipe: `BIKE`,
 * `BIKE_WHEELS` and the profiles (`CORE`, `SKIRT`, `COWL`) for the bike,
 * `BOX` for the box, `CYCLE`, `CYCLE_WHEELS`, `CYCLE_SPINE` and `CYCLE_SHELL`
 * for the neon bike, `CYCLE_OPEN`, `OPEN_WHEELS` and `OPEN_BODY` for its
 * open variant. Round parts use few facets, as in every batch.
