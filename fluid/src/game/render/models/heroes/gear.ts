/**
 * The gear exhibits: small machines from home, each built at its true
 * size and shown on an exhibit piece of its own, which together make the
 * hero. Their lights are on the `breathe` bank and nothing on them moves.
 *
 * - The turntable is the classic silver direct-drive record deck at its
 *   true size (`DECK`), standing on a waist-high black DJ table
 *   (`TABLE`) with a crate of record sleeves on the table's lower shelf.
 *   The deck's black rubber base carries the silver die-cast top on four
 *   round feet. On its left half turns (but here stands still) the
 *   platter with its rows of strobe dots round the rim (`STROBE_ROWS`),
 *   the black rubber mat and one record on it, its red label and the
 *   spindle. At the back right stands the tonearm (`ARM`): its round base
 *   with the height ring, the gimbal, the S-shaped tube in three straight
 *   pieces resting on its arm rest, the headshell with the cartridge at
 *   its front end and the counterweight behind the pivot, with the cueing
 *   lever beside it. In the front left corner sit the power knob with the
 *   strobe lamp behind it, the large start/stop button and the 33 and 45
 *   buttons; down the right edge runs the pitch slider, its green lock
 *   light beside its middle. Two dust-cover hinges stand at the back. The
 *   maker's name lies flat in the top's back left corner (`DECK_MARK`),
 *   reading from the front. The strobe lamp (group 0) and the lock light
 *   (group 1) breathe.
 * - The camera is the black rangefinder-style mirrorless camera at its
 *   true size (`CAMERA`), on a tripod at eye height, the tripod's three
 *   legs standing on a low white round plinth like a museum piece. Its
 *   lens points at the room (`+d`): a short fast prime (`LENS`) with its
 *   mount, aperture ring, focus ring and round hood, set low and a little
 *   left on the flat-topped body. The body is a black top plate over the
 *   leatherette front, with the short grip at the front's left; the large
 *   optical viewfinder window sits in the top plate's right corner, the
 *   small frame window and the viewfinder lever below it and the square
 *   focus assist lamp beside them. On top stand the exposure dial, the
 *   shutter button in its collar with its thread, the shutter speed dial
 *   and the hot shoe; at the back the screen and the eyepiece. The
 *   maker's name runs small across the top plate's front, left of the
 *   window (`CAMERA_MARK`), at the real lettering's size against the body
 *   (`CAMERA_MARK_SIZE`, the one mark under the 3 mm floor); its model
 *   name runs across the back of the top plate over the screen, reading
 *   from behind (`CAMERA_MODEL_MARK`), the one strip of the top plate
 *   where it fits at the 3 mm pixel floor. The
 *   tripod (`TRIPOD`): its centre column through the spider, a pan head
 *   with its tilt block, plate and handle, and three legs of two sections
 *   each. The focus assist lamp (group 0) breathes.
 *
 * The numbers each kind is built to are named above its recipe. Round
 * parts use few facets, as in every batch.
